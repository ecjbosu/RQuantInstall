RQuantInstall
=============

The Ultimate R Quant installation script 

This will install all packages for windows and linux.  The linux install does 
not check for dependent linux developemnt packages.  I could use some help 
setting up an accompaning shell script for rpm and deb installations.

<ul>Included is
  <li>install R packages function script</li>  
  <li>linux rpm developement package install shell script</li>  
  <li>Rprofile.site file that demonstrates how to set up R to handle different working 
  environments from beta to Production by pointing to different source code and 
  data locations.</li>
</ul>
